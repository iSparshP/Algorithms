## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of algorithms covering a wide range of topics, including stl data structures, sorting, searching, and more. Each algorithm is implemented in one or more programming languages for educational purposes. You can use this repository to:

- Learn and understand different algorithms.
- Explore algorithm implementations in various programming languages.
- Contribute your own implementations or improvements.

## Algorithms

Here's a list of some of the algorithms I've covered so far:

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - sort()
  - sort comparator function

- **Data Structures**:
  - stack
  - queue
  - priority queue
  - array

- **Searching Algorithms**:
  - Binary Search
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - ...

- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - Fibonacci Sequence
  - Knapsack Problem
  - knights problem
  - sudoku

This list is not exhaustive, and I'll continue to add more algorithms as I learn and implement them.

## Languages

I've implemented these algorithms in various programming languages, including:

- C++


Feel free to explore the code in your preferred language.

## Usage

You can clone this repository to your local machine to explore the algorithms and their implementations. Each algorithm is contained within its own directory and includes a README.md file explaining the algorithm, its time complexity, and usage examples.

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/iSparshP/Algorithms.git]
