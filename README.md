## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of algorithms covering a wide range of topics, including data structures, sorting, searching, and more. Each algorithm is implemented in one or more programming languages for educational purposes. You can use this repository to:

- Learn and understand different algorithms.
- Explore algorithm implementations in various programming languages.
- Contribute your own implementations or improvements.

## Algorithms

Here's a list of some of the algorithms I've covered so far:

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - ...

- **Data Structures**:
  - Linked Lists
  - Binary Trees
  - Hash Tables
  - Stacks and Queues
  - ...

- **Searching Algorithms**:
  - Binary Search
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - ...

- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - Fibonacci Sequence
  - Knapsack Problem
  - Longest Common Subsequence
  - ...

This list is not exhaustive, and I'll continue to add more algorithms as I learn and implement them.

## Languages

I've implemented these algorithms in various programming languages, including:

- Python
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript
- ...

Feel free to explore the code in your preferred language.

## Usage

You can clone this repository to your local machine to explore the algorithms and their implementations. Each algorithm is contained within its own directory and includes a README.md file explaining the algorithm, its time complexity, and usage examples.

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-learning.git
